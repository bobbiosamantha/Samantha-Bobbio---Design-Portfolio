            Hi , I'm Samantha!
          </h1><span>With a creative background in fine art and current role in digital marketing I’ve found UI design is the perfect harmony of both of my strengths. I personally love answering user
          needs / feedback by creating unique and easy to use designs. Take a look at my past work and feel free to reach out, I am always interested in feedback and learning from other
          creatives!</span>

             Navimate is a social app focused on connecting people internationally. Navimate will allow users to find locals to hang out with who will offer genuine and unique experiences. The app
            will display locals within their travel destination who will say a little blurb about themselves and what they typically do on a night out. Travelers will then be able to sort through
            locals who they’d like to befriend. Creating this prototype took an immense amount of user interviews and marketing research.

         Harmonize is a data personalization and recommendation app that syncs with your streaming service of choice to create patterns out of your listening habits. Harmonize’s goal is to bring
        listeners of all streaming services to one place where they can view what their friends are listening to in real-time as well as view daily reports and analysis of their daily listening. The
        development of this app relied heavily on design research as well making many tweaks throughout user feedback trials.
